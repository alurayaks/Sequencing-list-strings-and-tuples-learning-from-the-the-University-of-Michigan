# in for loops, use plural names for the sequence and singular names for the iterable variables.

# e.g for fruit in fruits:
#    or for bench in benches

#benches is the iterable(the sequence) and it comes after the in while bench is the iteration variable
#(it is bound to each item in the sequence.

# note that an integer cannot be iterated
